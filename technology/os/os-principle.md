[**Serial port**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port)

>  In computing, a serial port is a serial communication interface through which information transfers in or out sequentially one bit at a time. This is in contrast to a parallel port, wich communicates multiple bites simultaneously in parallel. Throughout most of the history of personal computers, data has been transferred through serial ports to devices such as modems, terminals, various peripherals, and directly between computers.

[**Parallel port**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_port)

> In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), a **parallel port** is a type of [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_interface) found on early [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) ([personal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer) and otherwise) for connecting [peripherals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral). The name refers to the way the data is sent; parallel ports send multiple [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) of data at once ([parallel communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_communication)), as opposed to [serial communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication), in which bits are sent one at a time. To do this, parallel ports require multiple data lines in their cables and [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_port_(hardware)) connectors and tend to be larger than contemporary [serial ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port), which only require one data line.

[**USB**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB)

> **Universal Serial Bus** (**USB**) is an [industry standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard) that establishes specifications for cables, connectors and [protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol) for connection, communication and power supply ([interfacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing))) between computers, [peripherals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral) and other computers.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#cite_note-2) A broad variety of [USB hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware) exists, including 14 different [connector types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware#Connector_types), of which [USB-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C) is the most recent and the only one not currently deprecated.

> First released in 1996, the USB standards are maintained by the [USB Implementers Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_Implementers_Forum) (USB-IF). The four generations of USB are: [USB 1.*x*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#USB_1.x), [USB 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#USB_2.0), [USB 3.*x*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_3.0), and [USB4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB4).
